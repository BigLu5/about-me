        Hello! My name is Lee and I am an aspiring web developer currently
        enrolled on the Tech Educators bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am based in Cambridgeshire, in a village about 9 miles south of
        Cambridge called Duxford to be exact. Duxford is best known for its
        airfield which played an important part in the Battle of Britain during
        World War II and is now home to a branch of the Imperial War Musuem.
      </p>

        Previously I studied Film Studies at the University of Derby where I
        achieved a BA <abbr title="Honors">Hons</abbr> degree. My top 5 films
        are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mulholland Drive (2001, dir. David Lynch)</li>
        <li>Fargo (1996, dir. Joel Coen)</li>
        <li>Taxi Driver (1978, dir. Martin Scorese)</li>
        <li>Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988, dir. Terrence Davies)</li>
        <li>This is Spinal Tap (1984, dir. Rob Reiner)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I spent some time working for the high street pharmacy Boots in the
        operations team which contributes to the smooth running of the business.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a keen cyclist and enjoy cycling around the Cambridgeshire
        countryside on my road bike.
