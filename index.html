        <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
        <img src="./images/duxford.jpg" alt="Duxford airfield" class="img" />
        <p>
          I live in Cambridgeshire, in a village about 9 miles south of
          Cambridge called Duxford to be exact. Duxford is best known for its
          airfield which played an important part in the Battle of Britain
          during World War II and is now home to a branch of the Imperial War
          Musuem.

          I spent some time working for the high street pharmacy Boots in the
          operations team which contributes towards the day-to-day running of
          the shop.
